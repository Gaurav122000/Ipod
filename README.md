#I build an iPod App using React, CSS, and Javascript. It is responsive across all devices. (With the help of Coding Ninjas)
In this app, users can access settings, menus, Music, Coverflow, and games on the iPod.

#How to use:-
Go back from the particular menu to the main menu by clicking the Menu button and accessing the main menu from the home screen using the Menu button.
To go inside the menu by clicking the center button.
Click and hold on to the circular menu and circularly move the mouse inside the menu boundary (the white circle is the menu) to navigate in the iPod menu.
Listen to music by selecting “All Songs” in the Music menu.
To toggle between the themes in settings: Classic & Dark.
To change the wallpaper of the app in the settings.
